# Predicting D.C. Residential Property Appraisal Values

## Overview
The nation’s capital, Washington, D.C., is filled with a vast number of residential properties, many existing for well over a century, while others are brand-new. These residential properties display numerous architectural styles and reflect the city’s history as well as the incredible diversity that makes the district unique compared to any other place in the United States. Washington, D.C., consists of eight respective wards, with each ward varying in its residential properties, ranging from modest starter homes for new families to massive mansions inhabited by the district’s elite. Though differences exist in the styles and sizes of the properties, each property is special and unique to Washington, D.C., contributing to the incredible landscape of residential properties that define the district.

The government of Washington, D.C., is tasked with the responsibility of accurately predicting the appraisal values of residential properties, as a portion of these predicted appraisal values constitutes the ad valorem property tax that owners must pay to the district. To fulfill this duty, the Office of Tax and Revenue’s Computer-Assisted Mass Appraisal (CAMA) database, maintained by the Assessment Division within the Real Property Tax Administration, serves as the data source for developing techniques to predict appraisal values, from which property taxes are derived. This database contains a comprehensive sale history of active properties listed in the district’s real property tax assessment roll. Furthermore, the database contains an extensive number of characteristics of these properties at the time of their sales, and the contents of the database are updated daily.

This research utilized multiple D.C. residential data sources maintained by the Washington D.C. government, including the CAMA database. The data spanned five years of residential property sales, covering both houses and condominiums from January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2024. Data preprocessing was performed, along with exploratory analysis using statistical methods such as Spearman’s rank correlation and ANOVA, paired with visualizations like density plots, box plots, and scatter plots. Then, twelve supervised machine learning models were developed, six for predicting residential house values and six for predicting residential condominium values. This included three tree-based ensemble algorithms for both house and condominium models, with training conducted on the initial 80 percent of the data in ascending time order and testing on the remaining 20 percent. Among these models, CatBoost had the lowest RMSE for houses, while XGBoost had the lowest RMSE for condominiums.
